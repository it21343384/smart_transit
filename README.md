Ai Optimized Transit Innovating Bus System

## Introduction

Smart Transit bus management system for the smooth operation of public transportation systems. It affects how efficiently buses run,  how safe they are, how reliable the service is and how financial manage. Many bus management systems still use outdated methods and manual processes, which leads to inefficiencies and higher costs. With the growing need for public transport and the push for more sustainable urban mobility, there's an urgent need for innovative solutions in bus operations management.
